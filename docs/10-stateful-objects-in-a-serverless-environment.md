Durable entities are a special type of Azure Function that allow you to implement stateful objects in a serverless environment. They make it easy to introduce stateful components to your app without needing to manually persist data to external storage, so you can focus on your business logic.

Some of the benefits of using durable entities are:

They provide a simple and intuitive way to model and manipulate state as classes and methods, or as functions and messages.
They enable efficient and scalable processing of large datasets that have a high volume of writes, by distributing the work across many entities, each with a modestly sized state.
They offer reliable and durable state management, by automatically persisting the state of each entity to Azure Storage, and ensuring that all operations on a single entity are executed serially and in order.
They support various scenarios, such as event computing, real-time stream processing, data movement, event sourcing, and more, by allowing entities to communicate with other entities, orchestrations, and clients by using messages that are implicitly sent via reliable queues.
